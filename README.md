# MY projects
-This project is related to the application of artificial neural network to cryosphere where I implemented the ANN for the prediction of SURFACE MASS BALANCE values for chotta shigri glacier based on the past data of SMB vaues with temperature and precipitation as the independent data. The input data is the temp and precipitation data and output is smb values. The graph attached is the final plot of the data predicted by the model and compared with already available SMB values for the years.    Applied Artificial neural networks to the Cryosphere for prediction of surface mass balance and processed the relation of change in glacier mass balance with elevation.    Analyzed the annual and daily variations of mass balance over 46 years and 43 elevations to determine the timing and magnitude of the transition of hydrological regimes.
