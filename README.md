# MY projects
I have created the two projects 
- one is the application of artificial neural network to cryosphere where I implemented the ANN for the prediction of SURFACE MASS BALANCE values for chotta shigri glacier based on the past data of SMB vaues with temperature and precipitation as the independent data. The input data is the temp and precipitation data and output is smb values. 
- The graph attached is the final plot of the data predicted by the model and compared with already available SMB values for the years.

-> second one is the instagram clone project which I did it for learning the sql where I have created the instagram dataset and then performed the query extraction.
